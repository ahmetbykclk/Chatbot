# Chatbot

This repository contains two Python scripts: `Chatbot.py` and `JokeGeneratorChatboy.py`, which implement two different chatbots. The `Chatbot.py` script is a simple text-based chatbot that can respond to greetings, inquire about its well-being, say farewell, answer questions about its identity, and offer assistance. The `JokeGeneratorChatboy.py` script, on the other hand, generates random jokes using the `pyjokes` library.

## Chatbot.py

The Chatbot.py script implements a basic text-based chatbot that can respond to various patterns, including greetings, questions about its well-being, farewells, questions about its identity, and offers assistance. It uses the nltk library for natural language processing.

## JokeGeneratorChatboy.py

The JokeGeneratorChatboy.py script implements a joke generator chatbot that uses the pyjokes library to fetch random jokes. The chatbot will provide a random joke each time you press Enter.
